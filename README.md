Description : This mobile app was created for a purpose of a assignment.
The goal of the app was to make a sealed simulator and draft simulator practice for any new decks released by Magic the Gathering so it could help , players before drafting at the match. It would also help them learn more details about the cards itself.
We also implemented some AI to draft with but this version 1 of the app is a simple round table random card generator.
